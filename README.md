# Autoinstallation scripts

For some time, I installed libraries for my embedded systems manually from the command line. It takes more time than the autoinstallation script or docker. In this repository I will add more scripts for autoinstallation. If someone uses this repository, but he lacks some packages - write and I will add. Scripts will work for Debian(Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux..) based systems.

## List of packages

1. Script.sh
a. Opencv
b. Dlib
c. Eigen

2. Caffe.sh

### Installing


```
git clone https://github.com/popikeyshen/scripts
cd scripts
sudo bash ./install.sh
```
